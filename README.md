# WebDev-Stoga
The ultimate resource list for the aspiring web developer

## Introduction
One of the most difficult parts of learning to code is finding the right resources to learn from. That's why I created this resource list, too help out anyone looking to learn a new skill that's hard yet fun and rewarding. You don't need to be a math or science genius to become a developer. Just like learning a world language, all you have to do is practice consistently, 20-30 minutes a day, and you'll learn the language really quickly. If you're looking to build a web app, desktop app, website, game, and even Android and IOS apps, then this resource list is for you.

## Basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Summary
Every single website on the internet is built solely on these three languages.

1. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and is responsible for the words and images of any website. 
2. CSS stands for  Cascading Style Sheets and is responsible for the styling of most websites- the font family, font size, text color, background-color, button size, etc. 
3. JavaScript is responsible for user interaction. For example when you hit enter on the Youtube search bar, JavaScript is what tells Youtube to load videos with the name that you entered in the search bar.

### Basic Tutorials
1. [dash.generalassemb.ly] (dash.generalassemb.ly)- Great intro to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by creating different websites. The best tutorial in this basic list in my opinion.
2. [freecodecamp.com] (https://www.freecodecamp.com/)- Fantastic community with good tutorials on HTML, CSS, and JS. Also has projects for more intermediate levels of coders.
3. [w3schools.com] (w3schools.com)- Indepth tutorials on the different parts of HTML, CSS, and JS (more like documentation, so if you forget something about HTML, such as the `<div>` tag, you can look here for help.

### Coding Resources
+ [codepen.io] (codepen.io)- How can I practice HTML, CSS, and JS on my own? Use this website! It's an incredible coding playground which allows you to easily test out your skills in each language. Like google drive, your coding projects (called pens) will be saved to your account and can be accessed from any browser.
+ [atom.io] (atom.io)- What if I want to practice HTML, CSS, and JS on my desktop instead of the browser because I want to use multiple files, locally downloaded images, etc. Well then you'll need an IDE (Integrated Developemnt Environment)- fancy talk for a code editor. Atom is the code editor which I personally use, and is free, open source, and developed by Github. [sublime text] (https://www.sublimetext.com/), [brackets] (http://brackets.io/), and [vscode] (https://code.visualstudio.com/) are great choices as well. 

## Intermediate CSS and JavaScript

### Summary
Now that you have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JS, it's time to learn some more advanced tools to speed up your coding workflow and allow you to write cleaner code.

### CSS
1. Learn a CSS preprocesser such as [sass] (http://sass-lang.com/) or [less] (http://lesscss.org/). Basically what happens is that you write your styling in sass, and then it is processed into CSS so the webpage can read it. Sass is a little more popular, but both are great. These frameworks will allow you to use CSS variables, functions, and even importing functionality of different sass/less files. 
2. I'd strongly suggest learning a
