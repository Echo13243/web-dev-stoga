# WebDev-Stoga
The ultimate resource list for the aspiring web developer

## Introduction
One of the most difficult parts of learning to code is finding the right resources to learn from. When I first started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript about a year ago, I was overwhelmed by the different tutorials on Youtube, Google, Github, giving me outdated, conflicting, or hard to understand information. 

That's why I created this resource list, too help out anyone looking to learn a new skill that's hard yet fun and rewarding. You don't need to be a math or science genius to become a developer. Just like learning a world language, all you have to do is practice consistently, 20-30 minutes a day, and you'll learn the language really quickly. If you're looking to build a web app, desktop app, website, game, and even Android and IOS apps, then this resource list is for you.

## HTML, CSS, JavaScript
These three languages are the building blocks of any website.
