# WebDev-Stoga
The ultimate resource list for the aspiring web developer

## Introduction
One of the most difficult parts of learning to code is finding the right resources to learn from. When I first started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript about a year ago, I was overwhelmed by the different tutorials on Youtube, Google, Github, giving me outdated, conflicting, or hard to understand information. 

That's why I created this resource list, too help out anyone looking to learn a new skill that's hard yet fun and rewarding. You don't need to be a math or science genius to become a developer. Just like learning a world language, all you have to do is practice consistently, 20-30 minutes a day, and you'll learn the language really quickly. If you're looking to build a web app, desktop app, website, game, and even Android and IOS apps, then this resource list is for you.

## HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Summary
Every single website on the internet is built solely on these three languages.

1. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and is responsible for the words and images of any website. 
2. CSS stands for  Cascading Style Sheets and is responsible for the styling of most websites- the font family, font size, text color, background-color, button size, etc. 
3. JavaScript is responsible for user interaction. For example when you hit enter on the Youtube search bar, JavaScript is what tells Youtube to load videos with the name that you entered in the search bar.

### Basic Tutorials
1. [dash.generalassemb.ly] (dash.generalassemb.ly)- Great intro to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by creating different websites. The best tutorial in this basic list in my opinion.
2. [freecodecamp.com] (freecodecamp.com)- Fantastic community with a good tutorials on HTML, CSS, and JS. 
3. [w3schools.com] (w3schools.com)- Indepth tutorials on the different parts of HTML, CSS, and JS (more like documentation, so if you forget something about HTML, such as the `<div>` tag, you can look here for help
